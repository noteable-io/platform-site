# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Serve

```
$ npm run serve
```

This command starts a local HTML server for testing the static content generated by the `build` command.

### Deployment

When commits are merged to main, they're automatically deployed to Pages using [pages.yml](.github%2Fworkflows%2Fpages.yml)
