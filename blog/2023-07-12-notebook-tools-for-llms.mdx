# Notebooks: A Tool for LLMs

## Introduction

The Noteable Plugin for ChatGPT exposes rich computational notebooks to GPT Models to allow you to analyze data more quickly.

Notebooks are a pivotal tool for data scientists, researchers, and engineers. Now they're available for everyone. Notebooks allow us to communicate ideas, explore data, and share results. Notebooks are a tool for thinking. Most people use them to explore data. They're also a great little laboratory for experimenting with APIs.

Artificial Intelligence companies like OpenAI clearly included notebooks as part of the corpus of training data for their Large Language Models because these models **know notebooks**. ChatGPT can create well documented notebooks with code and prose. It has shown me whole new ways of using libraries and analyzing data that I had not thought of before. Anyone who knows notebooks and interactive computing in general, knows what this means. It's a big deal.

Please create an ETL notebook for the [IMDb dataset](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)

I have created a new notebook named [IMDb_ETL.ipynb](https://app.noteable.io/f/d3d944d0-5a18-48b3-bf3e-fdb59d8a5dea/IMDb_ETL.ipynb) for the IMDb dataset ETL process. You can access it directly. Now, let's start with the ETL process.

Early experiments with integrating LLMs into notebooks were very promising. Open source projects have shown the potential of integrating IPython and Jupyter with Large Language Models (Jupyter AI, genai, dangermode). It allows for deeper exception handling, inline assistance, and even code generation. It's fantastic. Due to technical limitations in open source Jupyter though, there's no realtime server side access to the notebook document model.

What we needed was a way for the model to be able to create and edit cells, start new notebooks. Everything that would be part of a data scientist's workflow.

## Noteable's Headless Execution

Building on top of our foundations for [realtime collaboration and scheduled notebooks](https://github.com/noteable-io/papermill-origami), we began work on a plugin that would allow the model to do just that.

```python cell count=1
import openai
import noteable
```

```python cell count=2
noteable.create_notebook(
    project_id=default_project,
    notebook_name="Runtitled.ipynb"
)
```

There isn't just one way to code.

Many ways to create data products.

Code interpreter has its own products

Ephemeral response within it --> We did this with tmpnb

No levers

We're providing levers

## Code Interpreter vs. Noteable Notebooks

There's a bit of a debate about OpenAI's Code Interpreter vs. Noteable Notebooks. That's silly. They're both using GPT models! The difference is in the interface and the environment provided. OpenAI is providing several incredible bits we've been building on top of:

- ChatGPT Plugins
- Chat Completions API
- Function Calling

## Noteable, ChatGPT, and the Code Interpreter

# Outline

- Delight about how these large language models can reason about coding and analysis tasks
- Initial experiments with OpenAI's models, with `genai` and exception handling
- Plugin: from `dangermode` to `noteable`
- Scaling up, a la tmpnb
- Futures

## Strengths

- The result of computation with the model is stored in a data driven document, a notebook
- We believe in the power of notebooks as expressive reproducible communication tools
- Flexible hosted environment that gives you access to what you need

In both code interpreter and Noteable it helps you see the raw power in OpenAI's Large Language Models. I can't wait to see these models improve for all computational workflows. There is a lot to explore, automate, and discover.
There are a few areas where the Noteable plugin is much weaker:

speed of startup -- we require starting up a session with a notebook and then creating cells. This is not as fast as "just write code immediately", but it gives you persistence
We do not control the model, temperature, etc.
These last two are much better handled with direct usage of our realtime service using chat functions, where there's a lot more control and even speed, context, and customization.
