Workers across industries want to work smarter, not harder, and recently people around the world got access to Large Language Models (LLMs, in this article also referred to as ‚Äúgenerative AI" or just AI), powerfully smart tools that could help them do just that. But, are they really the magic wand they're made out to be?

### What's an LLM?

Generative AI models use complex algorithms to produce responses (text, code, answers to questions, but also images, videos, art, voice, etc.) based on very large training data sets that were used to train the model. Large Language Models use text and code training data and output text and code responses.

## The rise of the bots

It's clear the rise of accessible LLMs has been a game-changer for many industries, especially software development. If you _haven‚Äôt_ been using these tools, you might be surprised at how prevalent AI has become. According to [GitLab's DevSecOps survey](https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey), ‚ÄúThe vast majority of respondents (90%) said their organizations are using AI in software development today or plan to, and 83% said it is essential to implement AI to avoid falling behind.‚Äù

Our engineering team at Noteable has been actively using OpenAI since last summer with the `genai` Python package for cell-level AI error help for notebooks. Then we started integrating it into various aspects of our product ‚Äî from building our ChatGPT plugin and in-app error fix suggestions, to the upcoming AI chatbot in our sidebar - and seeing incredible results. And it‚Äôs not just for the product - many of us are exploring AI tools for daily work tasks, personal use, and play. (TODO add links)

## But not the fall of the humans?

Here‚Äôs the catch ‚Äì amidst the buzz about what AI tools can achieve, the critical role of humans in these interactions often takes a backseat. Critics of AI‚Äôs capabilities cite the initial ‚Äòcrud‚Äô, mistakes, and just plain bad code that comes out of LLM tools as a reason they may never be useful, but the reality is more nuanced.

AI _can_ significantly boost productivity, but the human worker remains essential. You can‚Äôt just copy and paste AI-generated code onto production and call it a day. From writing concise prompts, to refining responses, to managing the risks and biases, there is a lot of work to making great things with the help of an LLM.

As developers who value craftsmanship, we want to ensure our work meets high standards and retains authenticity. But, if AI can do some of the hard, boring, or tedious stuff, let's use it! The goal is to strike a balance, ensuring our work is not just efficient but also authentic and high-quality.

### What are the tools?

There are a ton of Listicles with tools for developers and others. I liked [this one by LeadDev.com](https://leaddev.com/tech/11-generative-ai-programming-tools-developers). The most popular tools seem to be from ChatGPT (the chat interface, their Code Interpreter and plugins) and many 3rd party tools are using OpenAI's API and models. GitHub's Copilot is especially made for software developers, and their Copilot Chat is in beta now. Open source tools include: XYZ? [TODO add links]

## What can AI do for you?

It‚Äôs not hard to find people online raving about what AI can do. From summarizing documents to generating boilerplate tests, there are obvious tasks that generative AI makes faster. But what‚Äôs really interesting is the way it can change your _feelings_ about the job. [GitHub‚Äôs Copilot study](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) found that ‚Äú‚Ä¶productivity gains went beyond speed, with 74% of developers reporting that they felt less frustrated when coding and were able to focus on more satisfying work.‚Äù [[source]](https://github.blog/2023-04-14-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-way-developers-work/#how-developers-are-using-generative-ai-coding-tools).

By speeding up repetitive tasks, reducing some of the cognitive load, and doing the more tedious parts of the job, AI can empower developers to tackle bigger problems, learn new languages, or work on side projects that may have been too tedious otherwise.

### Brainstorming solutions & first drafts

This is a favorite use case for myself and others I‚Äôve talked to. Sometimes the first step is the hardest when starting a new project, feature or document. LLMs can get you over that writers block with a quick prompt asking it to brainstorm ideas or outline solutions. Then you can throw it out or use it, but either way you‚Äôll have a clearer idea where to begin.

This is especially fun for new projects or new programming languages. Little side-projects and "proofs of concept" become much easier with AI making the first pass; use them to create starter code and accelerate the initial setup and get to the more interesting tasks.

### Debugging

Imagine this: You‚Äôre on call and there‚Äôs an incident - the production application has a bug, but it‚Äôs in a part of the codebase you‚Äôve never touched. üôÄ You could spend hours combing the codebase and documentation, or you could send over the context - error message, relevant code, etc - to a code-trained LLM for help. While it probably can‚Äôt solve the problem, it can help illuminate the unknown and act as a virtual, interactive rubber duck debug partner in getting to the root cause. And it's generally non-judgemental, which is great.

In a less stressful daily scenario, LLM tools in your IDE can help debug small errors and refactor code. GitHub Copilot was designed specifically for this type of task. It uses a programming-specific AI model ("beyond" OpenAI Codex [according to an announcement in July](https://github.blog/2023-07-28-smarter-more-efficient-coding-github-copilot-goes-beyond-codex-with-improved-ai-model/#:~:text=The%20improved%20AI%20model%20behind,improvement%20over%20the%20previous%20model.)) that can access your entire codebase, so it has a good amount of context about the project.

### Explaining unknown code & libraries

Since LLMs are great at¬†summarizing large amounts of text, they're very useful for quickly comprehending a big code block or documentation from a library you're working with. Using these tools to understand unfamiliar code and errors can provide more direct answers than searching online, reducing context switching and¬†conserving mental energy.

### Boilerplate code, advanced auto-complete

GitHub‚Äôs marketing video for Copilot Chat aptly says, ‚Äúbusiness logic over boilerplate,‚Äù which resonates with how I use it regularly - to generate simple unit tests and repetitive functions. This means you can code faster and stay in the flow, instead of switching contexts to lookup how to write a specific syntax or code pattern you forgot. Recently our team wrote multiple E2E tests in a short one-hour pairing session by using Copilot to generate the basic outlines, adding robust coverage to a previously bare area.

### Writing drafts of documentation, emails, feedback, meeting notes

Engineering-adjacent tasks, especially those that involve writing, are a perfect use case for generative AI. LLMs were made to summarize, outline, and draft text. With the right prompt and interactions, these tools can help you increase your documentation coverage, write better feedback during review cycles, and draft proposals or tech specs for projects so much faster than starting from scratch.

## What must you do for the AI?

Despite their advantages, LLM tools come with plenty of limitations. They're often wrong and require diligent fact-checking, testing, and validation. Treating AI-generated responses with scrutiny and asking follow-up questions are essential practices for enhancing the quality of the final product.

### Do you really want to use AI for that?

There are still so many unknowns, risks & biases to consider. Many businesses are legitimately concerned about how LLM-powered tools handle important data and [some have banned them](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-restricts-use-of-chatgpt-joining-other-companies-wary-of-leaks-d44d7d34) from the workplace. Racially or culturally biased responses are a well-known risk as well. Only you and your company policies can answer the question of whether it's appropriate to use these tools at work.

It's also worth considering the cost-benefit ratio of time spent editing & iterating on the LLM response, as well as personal work preferences and abilities. Think about what you like to do, what you‚Äôre good at, and whether you even need LLM help in that area. If you're someone who enjoys writing, you may have AI write an outline for a proposal, but fill in the text content yourself so it's not generic. Similarly, the context matters - maybe it's fine for AI to generate an email to an insurance company, but one to a colleague is probably better written by hand so it stays authentic.

There is also the issue of how much current knowledge you have in the area, since you must be able to critique the outputs. Yes, an LLM might be able to write code faster than you, but it is well-documented how often it's wrong and buggy. You have to be knowledgeable enough to understand and correct the bugs it creates, or, as blogger and Microsoft employee Scott Hanselman¬†tweeted¬†‚Äì ‚ÄúOtherwise it will make the code wrong, 10x faster‚Äù [[source]](https://x.com/shanselman/status/1613052843652714497?s=20)

### Prompts and context matter.

When it comes to coversation-like interfaces like ChatGPT and Bing, the clarity and context of a prompt significantly influences the results. Often called prompt engineering or prompt design (link) learning how to write strong prompts is one key to harnessing the power of generative AI models.

Here are some common tips to better prompting:

- **assign a role or job title**: This helps in limiting the scope and tone of the AI‚Äôs responses.
- **ask it to collaborate**: Instead of telling it to do something, encourage conversation and interactions.
- **set boundaries**: Give it a specific area to focus on, like a specific coding language or problem area.
- **be clear & specific about the response you expect**: Use examples if you have them. If you're writing code you can send along a json schema or type interface to get more accurate results.
- **ask again a different way or ask for refinements**: Keep the conversation going or keep changing your prompt and note the differences in the responses. This is a great way to get better results and to learn what makes a good prompt for a specific task.

Here's an example prompt for ChatGPT using these suggestions:

<div style={{ width: "80%", fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "1rem auto" }}>
  ‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre a software developer with expertise in Javascript (assigning a
  role). Work with me (ask it to collaborate) on coming up with a JSON schema
  (specifying the response format) for a new e-commerce product catalog. This
  catalog has a product which has an id, name, price, and optional tags (further
  limiting the scope & specifying the response). We also need to think of other
  fields that might be useful for the catalog.‚Äù
</div>

And [here's how it turned out](https://chat.openai.com/share/6fb3a49a-825a-4ed7-8771-72ef9a263d61) when I tried it.

There are plenty of websites and blogs with advice on prompting. For an academic look, [ExplainPrompt](https://www.explainprompt.com/) explores LLM prompts from recent research papers. [The suggested prompts](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/student-use-cases-for-ai) for students by Harvard's Ethan Mollick offer insight into the deep specificity you can add when prompting, and are good starting points for learning new code concepts. If you really want to get into it, DeepLearning.ai offers a [prompt engineering course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) specifically for software developers using ChatGPT.

### Scrutinize and iterate on the responses you get

The importance of thoroughly reviewing AI-generated response cannot be overstated. Every time you have AI generate significant work for you, there are multiple next steps to edit, validate, clarify, and often ask again. This is where the time-to-polished-product tradeoffs have to be considered. When it comes to written work, it can take a lot of editing to get the results you want.

Your expertise is what will turn a basic LLM response into something great. As Luca Maria Aiello, from the IT University of Copenhagen, puts it: ‚ÄúAI has the potential to provide a significant productivity boost‚Ä¶ However, when it comes to fixing, assessing, improving, combining the response or to integrate it into complex projects, expertise is absolutely needed.‚Äù [[source]](https://leaddev.com/team/generative-ai-changing-how-computer-science-taught)

When it comes to using AI-generated code, [GitHub's solid advice](https://github.blog/2023-02-22-responsible-ai-pair-programming-with-github-copilot/) (quoted below) is to start with basic understanding and make sure you review, run, and test the generated response.

‚ÄúSo, how do developers know whether GitHub Copilot is generating good or bad code for them? To start, developers using GitHub Copilot should have some basic understanding of the language they are coding in. This will help them determine if the solutions GitHub Copilot suggests are valid. From there, the code should still be run and tested locally. And of course, code reviews should not be skipped!‚Äù

No matter which tools you're using, the responsibility is on you to ensure the quality of the work you produce. You have to review, test, and iterate on the AI generated content to make sure it‚Äôs what you want, and that there are no performance or security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The conversation around AI revolutionizing work in various fields, including coding, writing, and graphics, has been a mix of excitement, awe, denial, and fear. There's no question that LLM tools have a ton of uses, from productivity boosts to eliminating entire categories of tasks, but the core of a developer's job ‚Äî building robust new features and fixing tricky bugs ‚Äî still requires human brain power.

There's no magic software wand. Building software demands context about the whole codebase, understanding historical patterns and features, and grasping product requirements. Effective utilization of LLM tools by professionals must involve refining prompts, iterating, and critically assessing the generated content.

Still, the advent of these tools marks a significant stride in software development. Ongoing work has new tools accepting diverse inputs (voice! images!) and continual training improvements. Embracing LLM tools, while recognizing the irreplaceable role of human touch, paves the way for a future where technology and human creativity join forces to push the boundaries of what is possible. Best of all, you can use these AI tools today with your unique input and expertise to excel in your software developer role, and maybe even bring to life those side projects you‚Äôve been dreaming of!
