For so long, I have wanted an incredible environment to do interactive and literate computing with server side JavaScript. Some of the main requirements I've had are:

- Ease of package management
- Native support for TypeScript
- Commitment to web standards
- Top level async await
- Strong community and ecosystem

Deno has all of these.

(aside about kernel build out)

Now, I'm excited to officially announce support for Deno Notebooks on Noteable.

:::info

The Deno kernel is experimental ðŸ§ª. As with any data science work though, it's worth experimenting!

If you find bugs, report them either to us or to [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues).

:::

## Getting Started

You have two ways to launch a Deno kernel from Noteable:

- On any notebook, click to change the Notebook Settings from the lefthand sidebar. Then, select Deno from the dropdown menu.
- Using the Noteable Plugin on ChatGPT, ask it to start a Deno notebook. You might have to hint to it to check on what kernels are available.

From here, you can write JavaScript. You can write TypeScript too. It's a REPL though so you can make typing mistakes. Get messy!

```typescript cell count=1
console.log("Hello from Deno ", Deno.version.deno);
```

```cell output count=1
Hello from Deno 1.37.0
```

### The basics

- Top level async await

## Images, Markdown, and more

- Show display module
- Show how to use canvas
- Show how to use markdown

- Show how to load

## Where do we go from here?

I'm committed to making the data science ecosystem in Deno as strong as possible. I'm excited to see what we can build together.

- Arrow
- Polars
