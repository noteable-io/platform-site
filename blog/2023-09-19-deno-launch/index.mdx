For so long, I have wanted an incredible environment to do interactive and literate computing with server side JavaScript. Some of the main requirements I've had are:

- Ease of package management
- Native support for TypeScript
- Commitment to web standards

Deno has all of these.

In addition, Deno has a strong and kind development community and ecosystem. It is a joy to work with them.

Now, I'm excited to officially announce support for Deno Notebooks on Noteable.

The Deno kernel is experimental ðŸ§ª. As with any data science work though, it's worth experimenting!

If you find bugs, report them either to [us]() or to [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues).

:::

## Getting Started

You have two ways to launch a Deno kernel from Noteable:

- On any notebook, click to change the Notebook Settings from the lefthand sidebar. Then, select Deno from the dropdown menu.
- Using the Noteable Plugin on ChatGPT, ask it to start a Deno notebook. You might have to hint to it to check on what kernels are available.

From here, you can write JavaScript. You can write TypeScript too. It's a REPL though so you can make typing mistakes. Get messy!

```typescript cell count={1}
console.log("Hello from Deno ", Deno.version.deno);
```

```cell output count={1}
Hello from Deno 1.37.0
```

## Where do we go from here?

I'm committed to making the data science ecosystem in Deno as strong as possible. I'm excited to see what we can build together.
